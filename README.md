###What is it?
Strides is a web app that helps marathon runners find suitable accommodation for their upcomming race. Runners will be able to choose their marathon, reference point (start or finish line), travel dates and maximum budget, whereupon a map displaying a curated list of hotels within a specific radius of their chosen point will be presented.

###What can you do with it?
Choose your marathon, starting or ending point, budget, arrival and departure date, you will be taken to the map relative to the marathon you chose, which will display all the hotels matching with your preferences. You will be able to see the hotels details, such as name, image, price, rating, how long would it take to walk to the starting point of the marathon and suggested time to leave the hotel. You could choose to book the hotel, and will be redirected to the booking page on Expedia. The system allows you to send an email or an sms with the itinerary, only if logged in.
